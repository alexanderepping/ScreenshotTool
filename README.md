# ScreenshotTool
Small program to take screenshots the way I like it. Can be executed by for example keybindings.

## Dependencies:
This program uses scrot to take the screenshot, feh to show it and xclip to save the screenshot to the clipboard. scrot and xclip probably should be preinstalled.

You also have to download the feh config files from my repository. In the themes file you can change the used terminal to your favorite terminal.
